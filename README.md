# Detection
This project implements a pothole detection system using image processing and computer vision techniques. The system analyzes images to identify potential potholes and provides visual feedback. Additionally, it includes sound alerts for detected potholes.

# Image Processing:  
- Conversion to grayscale  
- Thresholding  
- Contour detection using different methods  
# Potholes Detection:  
- Bounding rectangle analysis  
- Visual feedback with rectangles and text  
- Sound alert for detected potholes
# Image Filtering:
- Blur
- Gaussian blur
- Median blur
- Erosion
- Dilation
- Morphological closing
- Canny edge detection
